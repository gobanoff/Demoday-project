    (collectively the "Services") provided by Gobazon Inc. or its affiliates (gobazon Inc. and the companies it directly or indirectly controls are referred
    to as " Affiliates"). This User Privacy Notice applies regardless of how you access or use these Services, including access via mobile devices
    and apps.We process your personal data for various purposes and based on several different legal bases that allow this processing. For example,
    we process your personal data to provide and improve our Services, to provide you with a personalized user experience on this website, to contact
    you about your Gobazon account and our Services, to provide customer service, to provide you with personalized advertising and marketing
    communications, and to detect, prevent, mitigate and investigate fraudulent or illegal activity. We also share your information with third parties,
    including service providers acting on our behalf, for these purposes. In addition, we may share your personal data among Gobazon Affiliates in order
    to fulfill our contract with you under the User Agreement and, if applicable, the Payments Terms of Use.Your personal data will be stored by us
    and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this

    processing purposes). Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps
    to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged or permitted to keep your personal data longer (e.g. for legal compliance,

    generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts, notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible or required, we
    restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where
    we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims, or where such retention
    is otherwise required or permitted by law. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory
    limitation or retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired. </p>
